The Global Shark Attack Dataset is a compilation of reported shark attacks from all over the world, dating back to the 1700s. The dataset includes information such as the date and location of the attack, the type of activity the victim was engaged in, the species of shark involved (if known), and the severity of the injuries sustained by the victim.

The dataset is maintained by the Shark Research Institute, and it is regularly updated as new incidents are reported. It is used by researchers, government agencies, and other organizations to study shark behavior and improve public safety.

The dataset can be analyzed to identify patterns in shark attacks, such as which species of sharks are most likely to attack humans, which activities are associated with the highest risk of attack, and which geographic areas are most prone to shark attacks.

It is important to note that the dataset is not comprehensive and may not include all reported shark attacks, as not all incidents are reported or documented. Additionally, the severity of injuries sustained by the victim is often subjective and can vary greatly, making it difficult to compare incidents accurately.
